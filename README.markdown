# jQuery "validationEngine2" (/'VE2')

## What is validationEngine?

validationEngine is a jQuery plugin which allows you to set validation rules by simply assigning CSS classes to the field to be processed. Those validation rules are then parsed by the plugin, and alert balloons are shown containing the error message(s).

## History of validationEngine/VE2?

This plugin is based extensively on [validationEngine by Cedric Dugas](http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/). After looking into the source to try and incorporate some further advances, I noticed that alot of the jQuery interactions were written in longhand, or were operating in a less-that-optimal fashion.

Of course, that tends to happen when a plugin evolves over time. I am even sure that this one may head in the same direction.

validationEngine was made available on GitHub, and relabelled [VE2 by Jeffrey 'jf' Lim](http://github.com/jf/jquery-validationEngine2---VE2--), so I forked it, updated the base from v1.6.5 to v1.7 and commenced hacking my contributions into it.
